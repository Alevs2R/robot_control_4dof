# Control system for 4DOF parallel robot

Implements forward and inverse kinematics, path planning and command execution for real robot.

Includes sources for Arduino, Java controller (sends commands from computer to Arduino) and Python which does trajectory planning.

This project is done in Innopolis Unversity during the Introduction to Robotics course.
